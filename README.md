# Helldivers 2 Data Dump
 Datamining for Helldivers 2, supporting the guts of https://helldivers.io/ and others. 
 
 Review the data in an easy frontend @ https://data.helldivers.io/
# Tutorial on how to get planet effects:
 - Go to https://data.helldivers.io/?settings=generated_planet_data
 - Click the planet you want (i.e. Hellmire) https://data.helldivers.io/?settings=generated_planet_data&index=36
 - .gameplay_modifiers will have references to id's if any are available. https://data.helldivers.io/?id=9189059319917937722
 - Check the environmental effect tag https://data.helldivers.io/?id=9189059319917937722&component=EnvironmentalEffectTag
 - EnvironmentalEffectType_IntenseHeat should display, repeat for any other gameplay_modifiers
# Tutorial on how to translate planetInfos from the api server response:
 - Go to https://api.live.prod.thehelldiversgame.com/api/WarSeason/801/warinfo, check planet info, make note of settings hash (i.e. 897386910)
 - Make a map of murmur2 hashes, of the debug_name's (can be seen from https://data.helldivers.io/?settings=generated_planet_data&index=36  (note... sometimes you ignore the actual debug name and just use the index... dunno why)
 - https://helldivers.io/murmur/planet_000 planet_000 has a 32bit murmur hash of 897386910
 - Then map planet_000 to the index of the planet settings @ https://data.helldivers.io/?settings=generated_planet_data
# Why doesn't weapon data seem accurate?
 The WeaponCustomizations component overrides some data, including projectile type and magazine size.
# Leaks?
 I do not support leaks. Please refrain from spreading them. The game devs are getting better at not including unreleased content in the game, but some still exists.
# Hiring a security engineer?
