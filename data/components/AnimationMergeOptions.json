    "max_start_time" : { "type": "float", "default": 0.1, "description": "Sets the maximum time into an animation that we can start, in seconds. If a value of `0.2` is set, it means that if we can find any existing player playing this animation that has played for 0-0.2 seconds, then we will reuse that player instead of creating a new one. The animation will jump to the position where that player is, instead of starting at t=0. The default is `0`, which allows animation evaluations to be merged only if they began in the same frame." },
    "max_drift" : { "type": "float", "default": 0.1, "description": "Controls how much the displayed animation time is allowed to drift from the actual animation time. If two animations that are sharing a player are played with different speeds, they will eventually drift apart. At some point the animations will be considered too different and the evaluator will be split in two. This parameter controls when that happens. A value of `0.2` means that if the animations differs more than 0.2 seconds, the evaluator will be split." },
    "clock_fidelity" : { "type": "float", "default": 0.97, "description": "This controls how much the animation will respect the set playing speed. By slightly changing the playing speed of an animation, the animation player can prevent two playing animations from drifting apart and thus forcing a split of the evaluators. A clock fidelity of `0.9` means that the speed will be within 90% of what has been requested: i.e. it is allowed to change by 10 percent. The default value of `1.0` means that the speed will be exactly what has been requested." }
